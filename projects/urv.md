During winter session 2020-2021, I was fortunate to participate in the College of Information and Computer Science's URV Program, a 5-week research experience for undergraduates in computer science at UMass.  

During the program, I was mentored by PhD student Bhawana Chhaglani, working on a project with two other undergraduates.  Our group worked with Python to develop adaptive sampling algorithms for 2D scalar fields, which implemented scikit-learn's Gaussian process in order to map fields to minimize time, minimize energy, and maximize accuracy.

At the end of the program, we had the opportunity to share our findings and our work through a quick presentation:
