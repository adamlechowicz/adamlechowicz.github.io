[**UMass BRUT is a UMass Amherst and UMass Dartmouth collaborative advocacy group**](https://www.umass.edu/cp/umass-brut) of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to celebrating, preserving and reimagining our Brutalist architecture, with a mission to raise awareness of the relevance and international significance of our Brutalist heritage in order to foster pride in our campuses.

As my contribution to the group, I used the foundation of my app [UMass Campus Architecture](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/projects/uca.html) and reshaped it into an interactive guide featuring the stunning Brutalist buildings at UMass Amherst and UMass Dartmouth.

Featuring 23 structures, UMass BRUT for iPhone and iPad captures the Brutalist heritage of UMass Amherst and UMass Dartmouth with detailed photography, architectural descriptions, and archival photography courtesy of the W.E.B Du Bois Library at UMass Amherst, and the Claire T. Carney Library at UMass Dartmouth.

Additionally, I created two brand new "Brutalism Tour" experiences, one for each campus, with 18 selected points of architectural interest, based on the existing GPS-based guided framework I developed for UMass Campus Architecture.  I iterated on my previous design to create a truly unique experience just in time for the UMass BRUT symposium titled *Brutalism + the Public University: Past, Present and Future*, held on October 16th and 17th, 2020.
