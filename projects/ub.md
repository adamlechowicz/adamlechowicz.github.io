[**UMass BRUT is a UMass Amherst and UMass Dartmouth collaborative advocacy group**](https://www.umass.edu/cp/umass-brut) of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to celebrating, preserving and reimagining our Brutalist architecture, with a mission to raise awareness of the relevance and international significance of our Brutalist heritage in order to foster pride in our campuses.

As my contribution to the group, I used the foundation of my app [UMass Campus Architecture](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/projects/uca.html) and reshaped it into an interactive guide featuring the stunning Brutalist buildings at UMass Amherst and UMass Dartmouth.

Additionally, I created two brand new "Brutalism Tour" experiences, one for each campus, based on the existing GPS-based guided framework I developed for UMass Campus Architecture.  I incorporated extensive learnings and iterated on my previous design to create a truly unique experience just in time for the symposium titled *Brutalism + the Public University: Past, Present and Future*, held on October 16th and 17th, 2020.
