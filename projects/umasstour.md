Working with University Relations and Admissions, I am currently collaborating with the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a guided tour experience app for iOS.

Using everything I learned from my previous projects "UMass Campus Architecture" and the "UMass BRUT" iOS app, I created a tour platform that supports a wide array of useful functions for both prospective students and current students.

The headline feature of the app is a slick, guided and narrated tour, which uses an array of iOS APIs (maps, GPS, proximity, audio) to deliver the official UMass tour experience for students who are on campus but haven't signed up for a traditional campus tour.  Collaborating with University Relations, Admissions, and the Visitor's Center, I am currently working on integrating the official campus tour route.

UMass Campus Tour also includes a fast and intuitive building search feature that provides walking or driving directions to any building or point of interest on campus - a lifesaver for first-year and transfer students unfamiliar with the campus layout.

This project is currently in development, and I anticipate substantial completion in Dec 2020-Jan 2021.
